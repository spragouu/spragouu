# 👋 Hi, I'm Dylan Sprague

### 🛠️ What I Work On
I'm a full-time developer working with the Microsoft tech stack — mostly:
- ⚙️ Blazor (WebAssembly), C# APIs, and SQL Server
- 🧪 Azure DevOps (Boards, Pipelines, Git Repos)
- 💡 Researching and implementing new technologies
- 🐧 Linux system administration (backup/first-responder duties)

My day-to-day has me focused on front-end development, but I frequently work across the full stack — with a small, collaborative team.
