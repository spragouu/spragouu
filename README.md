# 👋 Hi, I'm Dylan Sprague

**Senior Developer & Lead Technical Advisor**  
📍 Toronto, Canada | 💼 GreatIdeaz

### 🛠️ What I Work On
I'm a full-time developer working with the Microsoft tech stack - mostly:
- Blazor (WebAssembly), C# APIs, and SQL Server
- Azure DevOps (Boards, Pipelines, Git Repos)
- Researching and implementing new technologies
- Linux system administration (backup/first-responder duties for SiriusXM Canada)

My day-to-day has me focused on front-end development, but I frequently work across the full stack - with a small, collaborative team.
